Blocks used in the various timing tests to measure scalability as a function 
of total lines of input code. Each block has a couple of loadI operations, 
a lot of add operations, one store, and one output. The blocks are designed
so that they have a demand for 20 registers (e.g., MaxLive = 20) and an 
average Ready Queue length of 19. Thus, they really measure dependence on 
input size -- that is, they hold register demand (lab 2), dependence graph 
size (lab 3), and queue lengths (lab 3) uniform as the code gets longer.

The subdirectory "larger" holds blocks with 256,000 and 512,000 operations.
These are, in general, too large for student labs. They take too long to
run in the auto-timing tests and the student labs often fail to handle a
file of that size gracefully.
